        <p>Winter trekking in Nepal offers breathtaking views and fewer crowds, but it requires careful preparation and safety awareness. The high-altitude regions present unique challenges during the colder months.</p>
        
        <h3>Essential Gear for Winter Trekking</h3>

          <li><strong>Layered Clothing System:</strong> Base layer (merino wool), insulating layer (down jacket), and waterproof outer shell</li>
          <li><strong>Footwear:</strong> Insulated, waterproof boots with good traction. Consider microspikes for icy trails</li>

        <h3>Emergency Protocols</h3>
        <p>Always inform someone of your trekking plans and expected return. Carry a satellite communicator for emergency situations. Know the signs of altitude sickness and hypothermia.</p>
